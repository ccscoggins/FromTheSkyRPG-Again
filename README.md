    "https://github.com/ccscoggins/FromTheSkyRPG.git" (without the quotes).
 3. Clear the "User:" and "Password:" text boxes.
 4. For "Clone into:" specify a writable folder (on a local filesystem)
    that doesn't already contain "BasicGame-on-Gradle".
 5. Click on the "Next >" button.
 6. Make sure the "master" remote branch is checked.
 7. Click on the "Next >" button again.
 8. Make sure the Checkout Branch is set to "master".

10. Click on the "Finish" button.

    button.
